This system can be used to monitor sensors (Tinkerforge, currently, but it is extensible). The recorded datasets can be uploaded to a backend system implemented in PHP using the Slim framework. Next step is to add a frontend that queries the backend and visualizes the measured values.

See the ToDo.md file for features remaining to be implemented. 

See this link list for the frameworks used:

 * http://www.tinkerforge.com/de
 * https://github.com/google/guice
 * https://www.slimframework.com
 
There's a good reason, why 'Documentation' is part of the ToDo list.
